**Abstract:**
High performance computing has always offered batch computing services but demand is growing for a wider range of workflow and data services. Container orchestration is a perfect candidate for offering scheduling services for these types of workloads in a similar way. By leveraging container orchestration with Kubernetes, you can build a platform that includes both a service catalog and lets users run their own containerized services directly.

The power of such a platform is being able to stand on the shoulders of giants. This starts with leveraging Kubernetes for container orchestration and running these types of workloads. Next is using the internal Kubernetesâ€™ paradigms with Operators to provide higher level scheduling of specific types of applications to create a service catalog. Third is using the Kubernetes API to tie everything together under a single user experience.
