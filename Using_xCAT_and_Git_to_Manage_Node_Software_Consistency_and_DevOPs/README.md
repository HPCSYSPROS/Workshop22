**Abstract:**
Penn State ICDS has deployed a new HPC environment, Roar Collab, using xCAT as the bare metal manager. By combining features of objects and script definitions from xCAT with a Git Repository, ICDS maintains node software consistency that is accessible to a broader set of administrators with a fast and low learning curve. This proposal will present a review of how we used Open-Source software to implement DevOps to stand up and manage bare metal nodes and deploy stateless OS images. We will discuss in detail how we use GIT to maintain the nodes' firmware, drivers, and software. We will discuss how these have enabled administration without the in-depth familiarity of the xCAT deployment, thus allowing more team members to contribute. We know of other deployments using a similar method to maintain software consistency across nodes. We will detail the differences and discuss the pros and cons of the methods.
